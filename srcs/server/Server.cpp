	DESCRIPTION
	This is an implementation of the TCP protocol defined in RFC 793,
	RFC 1122 and RFC 2001 with the NewReno and SACK extensions.
	It provides a reliable, stream-oriented, full-duplex connection
	between two sockets on top of ip(7), for both v4 and v6 versions.
	TCP guarantees that the data arrives in order and retransmits lost packets.
	It generates and checks a per-packet checksum to catch transmission errors.
	TCP does not preserve record boundaries.
	A newly created TCP socket has no remote or local address and is not fully specified.
	To create an outgoing TCP connection use connect(2) to establish a connection to another TCP socket.
 	To receive new incoming connections, first bind(2) the socket to a local address and port and then call listen(2)
	to put the socket into the listening state. After that a new socket for each incoming connection
	can be accepted using accept(2). A socket which has had accept(2) or connect(2) successfully
	called on it is fully specified and may transmit data.
	Data cannot be transmitted on listening or not yet connected sockets.*/
